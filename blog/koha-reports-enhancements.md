I've been working on this enhancement to add muliple select runtime parameters to Koha Reports for three and half months. At some points I didn't know if it was going to happen but it passed QA, failed QA, passed QA again and made it into 24.05.
<Bug :id='35746'/>

I used the momentum from working in this area of the code to add a patch to improve the ui/ux when adding runtime parameters to reports.
<Bug :id='35856'/>

Later I submitted another enhancement to reports based on improvements to the multi select form in item search.
<Bug :id='37050'/>

Pedro spotted a bug in my first enhancement so I had to patch that too.
