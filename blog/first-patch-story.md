It's been acouple months since the Koha-US conference in Portsmouth. I've signed off on a few patches and through repetition am starting to get the process.

I'm testing this bug by running the page's html though the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options). 
<Bug :id='35157'/>

Which leads me to finding a different stray html tag and submitting my first patch.
<Bug :id='35365'/>

Running koha-testing-docker and testing other bugs ferequently not only teaches you about Koha, but it can help you finds bugs too.
