## Check the Koha Manual

You've probably been to the [Koha Manual](https://koha-community.org/manual/latest/en/html/) before. Don't be afraid to [contribute](https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Editing_the_Koha_Manual) when and where you can.

## Check the Koha Wiki

Familiarize yourself with [how to write a good bug report](https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Bug_Reporting_Guidelines) and learn the [development workflow](https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Development_workflow). Lurk around Bugzilla for a while to see how the process works. :tent:

## Check the Koha Dashboard

See what's new, what's ready to test and the latest progress in the community. The [ Dashboard](https://dashboard.koha-community.org/) is a great place to find inspiration or just to stay up to date.

## Hook up with the Koha Community

- :ocean: Lost in a sea of browser tabs?
- :bug: Bug driving you crazy? 
- :robot: Tempted to consult with an AI chat bot? 

Sometimes it's best to ask a smart group of humans if they can answer your question or help point you in the right direction. :compass: 

The new [Koha Community Chat](https://chat.koha-community.org/) on Mattermost is an awesome place to get in touch with experts in real time. It's like Slack, but open source and hosted by the community.

Can't get enough email in your life? Join the [mailing lists](https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Mailing_lists) too. :incoming_envelope:
