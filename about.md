## Who am I?

I've gone from teaching art and technology courses on Nantucket to training school administrators and teachers in Arusha, Tanzania. Along the way, I have collaborated with a wide array of professionals and learners, honed my coding chops, and become fluent in Swahili. My students in Tanzania won [first prize in technology](https://www.youngscientists.co.tz/fileadmin/user_upload/user_upload_A/Posters_2015/St_Jude.pdf) at a national science competition for their Raspberry Pi powered, SMS enabled model smart home. Since returning home to Cape Cod I have worked on the field crew of [Aquacultural Research Corporation](https://www.archatchery.com/), managed technology projects for a public school district. As the systems manager of [CLAMS](https://info.clamsnet.org) I helped migrate data to Koha and implement integration projects.

I like playing with synthesizers, drum machines and skateboards.

## What are chrono-synclastic infundibula?

:hourglass_flowing_sand: **Chrono** from Greek, χρόνος (khrónos, “time”), meaning time

:globe_with_meridians: **Synclastic** from Greek, σύν (sún, “with, together”) + κλαστός (klastós, “broken in pieces”) + -ic, meaning curved towards the same side in all directions

:tornado: **Infundibulum** from Latin, meaning funnel

This phenomenon from the 1959 novel [The Sirens of Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan) by [Kurt Vonnegut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut) is something like a black hole or time warp. :hole:

When you enter a chrono-synclastic infundibulum, you are multiplied across time and space. Your normal human conciousness is altered, enabling you to understand the interconnected structure of disparate moments and even percieve the future. 

It is a vortex into a singularity where "all different kinds of truths fit together" which kind of sounds like the git repo of an open source project to me. Plus this is a library software dev blog so it has to have a literary reference.

Vonnegut lived in [Barnstable Village](https://www.sturgislibrary.org/pdf/beenbarnstable.pdf) and served as a trustee of Sturgis Library, the [oldest library building](https://www.sturgislibrary.org/history-of-the-library/) in the United states.
